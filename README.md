A Real Automatic Gearbox App for Assetto Corsa
Updated by DefensiveGuy

This app is a fork of someone else's work. 

The original work can be found at https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/more-realistic-automatic-gearbox.33698/

To get this to work make sure data folder is present to grab info from tyre, drivetrain and other info so you can unpack the data.
For smoothest downshifting like a real automatic, go into drivetrain.ini folder and set downshift time to under 80 ms and turn off use on changes for autoclutch(set it to 0)
Use spacebar to change between drivemodes.
